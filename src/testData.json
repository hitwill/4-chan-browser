An integral part of National Socialism is Racial Idealism, an idea based in the unbounding love of one&#039;s own people. This love is expressed by placing the interests of the racial community to which you belong ahead of your own individual desires, understanding that this selflessness will be paid back in full by your fellow man.<br> <br>National Socialism believes in putting the nation before yourself. Despite this, there is considerable difference between the socialism of Hitler and that of Marxist doctrine. Hitler&#039;s nationalism has the patriotic motive of placing the good of one\u2019s country before personal ambition while retaining one&#039;s individuality and happiness, whereas Marxism squeezes the people dry in favor of a machine-like nation built only for profit.<br> <br>In short, National Socialism believes that all men are NOT created equal. Just as every individual has his strengths and weaknesses, so too does each race have qualities which are unique to that group. National Socialism believes in the improvement of your people through individual means; its goal is that each new generation of children will be better off than the one before it.<br> <br>\u16c9 - GROUPS\/PROJECTS OF INTEREST<br>https:\/\/projectwhite.org\/<br>gab.com\/Der_Sieg","filename":"nsgandsig","ext":".png","w":250,"h":250,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1583489997788,"time":1583489997,"md5":"KPjCYwuUk1D+ZPo2kkaKgA==","fsize":20761,"resto":0,"id":"LIX7Z4dc","country":"BE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nsg-sig","country_name":"Belgium","replies":97,"images":52,"omitted_posts":92,"omitted_images":48,"last_replies":[{"no":246786205,"now":"03\/06\/20(Fri)09:59:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Joseph Goebbels Tribute<br><br>https:\/\/www.bitchute.com\/video\/qOBe<wbr>BGDi94w7\/","filename":"hitler and goebbels","ext":".jpg","w":1797,"h":1233,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":85,"tim":1583506793290,"time":1583506793,"md5":"ZKDZRpQCGlve2s8ksmOCpg==","fsize":314963,"resto":246763934,"id":"edy10\/uz","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":246787232,"now":"03\/06\/20(Fri)10:09:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p246764086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;246764086<\/a><br>I am going to roll on that","time":1583507357,"resto":246763934,"id":"vck3IOwV","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":246787917,"now":"03\/06\/20(Fri)10:15:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p246772284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;246772284<\/a><br>You&#039;re talking about capitalism you stupid retard NEET","time":1583507731,"resto":246763934,"id":"QotZIOk7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":246789909,"now":"03\/06\/20(Fri)10:33:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is this how it was for you, brothers?","filename":"progression","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":2177,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":125,"tim":1583508800518,"time":1583508800,"md5":"sZDDx9Og+SgETVvNf1RFsA==","fsize":158296,"resto":246763934,"id":"1vJcwTSl","troll_country":"NZ","country_name":"Nazi"},{"no":246790420,"now":"03\/06\/20(Fri)10:38:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p246771352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;246771352<\/a><br><br>wud?","time":1583509094,"resto":246763934,"id":"5mSI10Je","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"}],"last_modified":1583509094},{"no":246788037,"now":"03\/06\/20(Fri)10:16:34","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Help me create a word!","com":"As you know, how we speak is how we think.

Not in a single moment do they tell people to abandon their individuality. It&#039;s you that believe that human individuality is the only aspect of our nature. Humans are egoistic and also altruistic, they are individualistic and also colletivistic. However, what brings large social change is collective action. Someone just doing things on their own, without any aid, direct or indirect, will not be enough for large changes.
