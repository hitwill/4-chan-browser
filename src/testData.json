I came here years ago after watching the hitler tribute video the lion. I was just a normie and someone posted it to facebook in some comment. I am a non white so naturally I was very adversed to what I was seeing. I couldnt believe people could be nazis in the 2000&#039;s.

Spitting venom. <br><br>Only you dont leave this hate behind when you leave pol. It stays with you. It warps your brain. It shortens your fuse.

I became a hypocritical poltard who just enjoyed hurting my fellow man if they dared to piss me off. <br><br>Sure you can write it off as just bantz. but its not. Its negative emotions. I have grey hairs now. Because anger is stress and stress ages you. Hate destroys the hater. This is my warning to you all. The person you hurt most with all hurtbox pseudo satire, is yourself. <br><br>I may be non white, but I can see that this hate is many of you as well. Its no way to live.

This is the class basis of bourgeois nationalism and of all bourgeois ideologies. [...] The most vicious manifestations of the development of bourgeois nationalism include the enslavement of the colonial and semi-colonial countries by the imperialist powers, the First World War, the aggression of Hitler and Mussolini and the Japanese warlords during the Second World War, and the schemes for the enslavement of the whole world undertaken by the international imperialist camp, headed by American imperialism.[3]","filename":"3f8e308f2a323b219d29a196c400200a-imagejpeg","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":580,"tn_w":172,"tn_h":249,"tim":1583234639847,"time":1583234639,"md5":"8VpjfestZOJu\/5T0DmBB5w==","fsize":83445,"resto":0,"id":"bekV+Ebj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpills-for-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":19,"images":2,"omitted_posts":14,"omitted_images":1,"last_replies":[{"no":246307604,"now":"03\/03\/20(Tue)07:02:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p246307429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;246307429<\/a><br>*main<br>For now we need to focus on removing the top capitalists.
